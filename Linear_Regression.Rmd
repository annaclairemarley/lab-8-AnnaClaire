```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load the tidyverse and read in the data
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
salmon <- read_csv("salmon_simple.csv")

```

4. Exploratory scatterplot

```{r}
salmon_plot <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = year, y = salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point()
salmon_plot
```
Overall there does look like there is a linear relationship, but there are some random outliers around 2005 and 2012


5. Linear regression in R

```{r}

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)

salmon_model

```

Imports(tons) = -14982940 + 7550(Year)

y intercept means that after 1984, salmon imports are negative, which doesn't make sense


6. Model Diagnostics

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(salmon_model)
```
Residuals look normally distributed for the most part at first, but then become more widely spread.
